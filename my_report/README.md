# Introduction :



For the purpose of this project, i created a non-realistic city adding objects with a sci-fi twist.


# 1st Deliverable :

At fist the layout was placed. Then, I selected the plane which was added
at the hierarchy.
Then I proceeded with adding the background scene from the assets and adjusted the light in the inspector. I also created some highrises by using 3D objects like cubes and organised them at the hierarchy column in Unity. 
Lastly, I installed the pro-builder tool in order to transform and shape the buildings.


# 2nd Deliverable :

I started by dragging some props from the assets and then created one new item, specifically a rotating statue, with pro builder. 
Furthermore, I added some basic light to the set.



# 3rd Deliverable :

For the animation part I used keyframes to animate the locations and rotate the objects. The fist keyframe is for the begining of the motion and the last for the place I wanted it to end the animation.
